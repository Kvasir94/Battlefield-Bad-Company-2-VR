# BC2 VR rendering milestone time report

All displayed times are Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4), September 2026.

Approximately **78 hours 29 minutes elapsed (3 days 6 hours 29 minutes)** from creation
of the BC2 workspace to the recorded successful continuous headset feedback.
This is calendar elapsed time, including pauses, installation, sleep and testing
availability. It is not a measured active coding or compute-time total.

| Time (EDT) | Milestone | Elapsed from workspace creation |

| Sep 25, 03:12 AM | BC2 workspace created | 0h 00m |
| Sep 25, 02:37 PM | First distinct same-frame native eye pair | 11h 25m |
| Sep 25, 04:34 PM | First headset test: double image/flicker | 13h 22m |
| Sep 27, 04:59 PM | First positive headset stereo result; dots remained | 61h 47m |

## Work represented

September 25: transfer portable 1942/2142 lessons, scaffold the modular Frostbite
framework, discover BC2 camera/render ownership, implement x86/x64 GPU transport
and OpenXR presentation, and reach the first native eye pairs/headset attempt.
September 27: repair per-eye camera/projection binding and presentation continuity;
first positive headset feedback, with a remaining surface artifact.
September 28: correct decal/terrain projection artifacts, repair async request
lifetimes, improve desktop presentation pacing, and run the accepted continuous
campaign test. No new top-level report artifacts were recorded on September 26;
that absence alone is not proof of zero activity.

## Limits of the time accounting

There is no reliable accumulated active-work timer in these project records.
File/report timestamps establish milestones and work dates but cannot separate
all thinking/coding, unattended execution, waiting and idle periods. An exact
active engineering-hour total would therefore be invented.

The earlier Battlefield 1942/2142 research is reused foundation work and is NOT
included in the 78.5-hour BC2 project elapsed figure. The endpoint is user-accepted
rendering, not completion of controllers, weapons, IK, HUD or a packaged release.
The workspace creation marker and recorded-feedback timestamp bracket the work;
the conversation itself can begin before the former and approval can precede
its saved timestamp by a short interval.
