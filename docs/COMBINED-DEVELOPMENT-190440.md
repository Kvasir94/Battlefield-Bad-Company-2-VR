# Combined development checkpoint — October 3

This isolated composition combines the shared empty-reload/pickup repair with
the previously completed offline weapon pipeline. It passes 166 CTest suites
on x86, 166 on x64 and 695 Python tests. The exact private 22-part display cache
also passed both parsers and all 19 carried-weapon display identities.
Two local archives were extracted and their manifests rehashed; five exported
Python helper entry points passed from the isolated extraction. No game process
was started for these checks. Private geometry, local configuration, generated
registry/grip headers and test-output files are absent from the archives.

The single-player preview archive is a local review artifact. Its package field
build_verified=false is deliberate: the public source omits private generated
build inputs used for these binaries. Local build hashes and those private input
hashes are recorded in the frozen manifest, but this is not a reproducible public
build attestation. It has no headset acceptance and is not published.

The prepared headset target remains the separate headset-190440-test-readiness
launcher, whose full source and payload hashes were rechecked unchanged. SPAS
and XM8 monitor evidence belongs to that earlier payload lineage; no native
acceptance is inferred for these new combined binaries. AEK intermittent empty
reload still needs direct evidence. The common native empty guard and diagnostics
are retained, as is the user-accepted pickup recovery.

Production registry and draw-catalog inputs remain empty; authored baseline
acceptance stays off. New measured configurations are offline fixtures, GP30
nativeSightAccepted is false, and the vehicle-reticle producer is not activated.
The additional display rows do not grant firing, grip, reload or native hiding.
Underbarrel manual reload remains deferred and stock automatic reload retained.

Next: run the short prepared headset regression; use its new AEK boundary data
to fix any remaining shared empty-reload cause. Admit further AR/SMG and magazine-
fed LMG configurations through exact native descriptor checks plus the reusable
monitor fixture, then test the combined display/interaction payload. Keep pump,
bolt, pistol chamber and belt-fed reload work in shared mechanism modules. Scope
rendering, full-body IK, multiplayer and the installer remain unfinished.

No agents remain active at this checkpoint. The user is asleep; no unattended
headset session was started. Account remaining quota is not visible, so this is
a proactive checkpoint rather than a claim that the 10% threshold was reached.
