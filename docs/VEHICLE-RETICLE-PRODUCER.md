# Disabled mounted reticle source candidate

This stages a read-only PBLB driver gun-ray reader and an immutable stereo-pair producer. Native admission is compile-time false (`VehicleReticleNativeShotSourceAdmitted`); samples remain `Unproven` and Append cannot publish. The original staging work did not change gameplay, host presentation, native
hooks or CMake. Main now registers the standalone producer test in
[CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt). Production source binding remains
unadmitted; test integration does not establish native shot ownership. Only the frozen host candidate's `include/fvr/graphics/VehicleReticle.h` is required; its glyph renderer and OpenXR host changes are not dependencies.

The installed executable SHA256 is 3911fcc8914b0158c434cee36f19295316e715d4c9a0e70c857e8c39e3d54258. Fifteen complete code/data spans are fingerprinted, including the complete ordinary-shot function and the exact dispatch branch. The payload contains numeric fingerprints, not executable bytes or game assets. Native proof and bounded disassembly are saved separately.

Corrections from the older draft: ShotConfig+0x40 is MuzzleExplosion; +0x48 ActiveForceSpawnToCamera must join the two other camera/relative-aim flags in rejection. InitialDirection is a forward vector, not Euler rotation. The reader accepts canonical +Z (including native zero fallback), transforms the actual configured velocity and preserves its sign. It rejects inherited weapon velocity, noncanonical direction, optional effects+0x174 transform, and the WeaponFiringData+0x46 aiming adjustment flag. Native getter orientation is base*local while translation is added directly. Unsupported or missing fields invalidate observation. No HMD direction or desired target replaces the observed native ray.

The caller supplies the already accepted current local PBLB slot-zero BoatAim snapshot. Producer admission also binds full seat identity, route, scene, weapon generation, tracking space and original input lifetime. Eye and Complete reread source configuration and pointers before accepting the frozen pair. Both eyes retain one ray even when a subsequent valid pose changes. Reused tickets, duplicate eyes, tracking/owner/source loss and expired original input invalidate the pair. Input lifetime is capped at 100 ms and cannot be renewed by presentation. Reset advances ownership epoch without rewinding consumed tickets.

Evidence boundary: this is a configured, unspread source observation, not proven spawned-projectile or ballistic-impact telemetry. Saved evidence does not establish that this effects/config instance is the actual current mounted shot-dispatch instance, nor actual live optional-branch values. Installed disk code verification is not verification of live process bytes. A new monitor capture must prove same mounted owner/seat/source instance, actual shot source and unsupported flags before production admission or presentation can be considered. No game process, launch, input, injection or headset test occurred here.

Validation: x86 and amd64 /W4 /WX builds pass 13 groups each. One group maps the actual installed disk executable and verifies all 15 fingerprints, then independently mutates every span and requires rejection. The other 12 groups use synthetic object memory and test native-ray arithmetic, unsupported branches, source mutation, unchanged frame on disabled append, immutable pairs, ownership/tracking loss, deadlines, ticket reuse, clock overflow and mid-pair actual source rereads. Running without an executable argument explicitly skips disk proof and runs 12 portable groups. These are CPU fixtures, not native gameplay proof.

Integration additions: src/games/bc2/Bc2VehicleReticleSource.h, .cpp, Bc2VehicleReticleSourceProof.inc, Bc2VehicleReticleProducer.h; tests/Bc2VehicleReticleProducerTests.cpp; exact frozen include/fvr/graphics/VehicleReticle.h. The standalone target and portable CTest registration are already integrated
on main (`CMakeLists.txt:41–45`), compiling the test plus Source.cpp with
src/games/bc2 and tests includes and FvrCore/FrostbiteDiscovery links. The optional
private executable argument remains a separate disk-proof invocation, not a
requirement for the portable registration. Do not wire Observe/Append into production or copy old host glyph code.
