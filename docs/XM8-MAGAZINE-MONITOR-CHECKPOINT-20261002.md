# XM8 magazine monitor checkpoint — 2026-10-02 05:13 UTC

**The scoped XM8 physical magazine reload passed its actual consumer/native monitor test. Headset acceptance is pending.** The existing accepted SPAS reload and launcher-sight checkpoint remains the reference for user-tested behavior.

Trace: `reports/native-trace-20261002-051338-292`; receiver: `reports/xm8-physical-20261002-051337-814`. The monitor exercised the real hand claims, renderer-derived anatomical contact, magazine consumer, supply reservation, native hold and native transfer through isolated synthetic controller input. No count edits or invented receipts were used.

The sequence succeeded once: grip the attached magazine, request and receive the actual native reload gate, pull it out, release the cosmetic removed magazine, take a replacement from the pouch, approach and traverse the magnetic insertion rail, seat, receive the real native reload acknowledgement, retire the native cycle, then return to a fresh attached baseline. Loaded/reserve counts changed **28/163 → 30/161**, with the actual native server transfer and both client transfers occurring after physical seat. All 20 audit checks passed. Final state has no pending reservation, active cycle, retirement or equipment block; `reconciled=1`.

The consumer safely deferred one read gap while already holding the native gate and two during submitted transfer. Original evidence deadlines remained authoritative. The previously observed false cancellations did not recur: `cancelled=0`, no cancellation event. `cancel_cause=1` in the summary is the initialized default value, not a recorded cancellation.

Renderer evidence: **2,258 paired magazine poses**, zero fallback and zero binding, plan, reach, pose, hidden or freshness rejection. Root inspected both GPU-eye montages: a replacement magazine is visible at pair84 and the left hand grips it at pairs92–116, with the right-hand gun and world stable. Paired-copy counters alone were not treated as visual acceptance.

The monitor right-controller pose is `{0.15,-0.10,-0.20}` metres in OpenXR coordinates. This is fixture framing, not a production grip offset. Captured-geometry analysis showed that the earlier forward position exceeded left-arm reach. The replacement pose was derived from the measured rail path and captured shoulder anchors, then verified with the unchanged production solver in 1,024 cases on each architecture. Production reach limits and magazine profile tolerances were unchanged.

Evidence and source hashes are archived in the staging checkpoint's `evidence.json` and `manifest.json`; the reach derivation is in `bc2vr-recovery/xm8-diagnostic-reach-replay`.

## Scope and remaining verification

This proves one positive, partially loaded scoped XM8 magazine operation on the current BC2 build in an isolated monitor fixture. It does not establish headset feel, a combined SPAS→XM8→launcher-sight→SPAS run, empty-magazine behavior, loose retained partially loaded magazines, every campaign weapon, multiplayer or another Frostbite game.

BC2's ammunition authority remains pooled rounds: replacement consumes the native missing-round cost; the removed magazine is cosmetic and cannot add reserve ammunition. The generic transaction, supply, insertion and presentation pipeline is reusable, but additional weapon profiles still need measured geometry and native evidence.

Next verify the normal combined session with `-MagazineReload -SightFlip -BodyInventory`, one controller-input owner and neutral/drained boundaries between interactions. Keep isolated diagnostics excluded. The user is asleep; no additional headset acceptance is claimed.
